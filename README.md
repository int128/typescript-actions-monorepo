# typescript-actions-monorepo

This is a template of monorepo for GitHub Actions written in TypeScript.
Ready to develop on Visual Studio Code.

It is based on https://github.com/actions/typescript-action.

## Features

- Configuration for both yarn and vscode
  - [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)
  - TypeScript
  - Jest
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
- Continuous update of dependencies using Renovate
- Automated release


## Release strategy

When you merge a pull request into `main` branch, the workflow will release it to a release tag (such as `v1`, defined in [`release` workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml)).
A release tag is shipped with `dist` files.
`main` branch is not for production because it does not contain `dist` files.

This brings the following advantages:

- It prevents conflict of `dist` files in a pull request
- It reduces diff in a pull request
- It does not interrupt Renovate automation


## Example action

[![hello-world](https://github.com/int128/typescript-actions-monorepo/actions/workflows/hello-world.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/typescript-actions-monorepo/actions/workflows/hello-world.yaml)

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: int128/typescript-actions-monorepo/hello-world@v1
        with:
          name: bar
```
